# Logistic Regression
## File Set-Up
We only care about the sites that are polymorphic across the lineages. Using shell commands to speed the process up, we want to keep only positions that have at least 2 alleles represeted among the lineages. If the allele is consistent among all lineages, there is no reason to consider it. 

Sync files come in the format below. This is one line of data from the sync file (generated from the mpileup using Popoolation)
```
2R	2092604	A	246:0:0:0:0:0	173:0:0:0:0:0	186:0:0:0:0:0	174:0:0:0:0:0	188:0:0:0:0:0	179:0:0:0:0:0	209:0:0:0:0:0	175:0:0:0:0:0	154:0:0:0:0:0	159:0:0:0:0:0	163:0:0:0:0:0	195:0:0:0:0:0	159:0:0:0:0:0	178:0:0:0:0:0	187:0:0:0:0:0	170:0:0:0:0:0	112:0:0:0:0:0	167:0:0:0:0:0	159:0:0:0:0:0	215:0:0:0:0:0	181:0:0:0:0:0	220:0:0:0:0:0	215:0:0:0:0:0	205:0:0:0:0:0	109:0:0:0:0:0	168:0:0:0:0:0	194:0:0:0:0:0	198:0:0:0:0:0	168:0:0:0:0:0	162:0:0:0:0:0	206:0:0:1:0:0
```
The first three columns are chromosome, postion, and reference allele. After that, each column represents the allele counts for a lineage in this pattern A:T:C:G:N:Del where A,T,C,G are bases, N is missing data, and Del is a deletion at the site. 

We really want to sum up all the values in each category for a row to find out if several bases are present for each position

First, we split the coulmns based on the colon
```
awk 'gsub(/:/,"\t")' practice2.sync > practice2_manycols.sync
```
We now have so many columns (189!). We then want to add all the columns corresponding to certain categories and add this to the end of each line. I ended up generating 6 new columns. To get all the column values I needed for a category, I put all the columns into excel and sorted so I had a list of columns associated with each base. Adding plus signs was annoying though.
```
awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} {$190 = $4+$10+$16+$22+$28+$34+$40+$46+$52+$58+$64+$70+$76+$82+$88+$94+$100+$106+$112+$118+$124+$130+$136+$142+$148+$154+$160+$166+$172+$178+$184;} {$191 = $5+$11+$17+$23+$29+$35+$41+$47+$53+$59+$65+$71+$77+$83+$89+$95+$101+$107+$113+$119+$125+$131+$137+$143+$149+$155+$161+$167+$173+$179+$185;} {$192 = $6+$12+$18+$24+$30+$36+$42+$48+$54+$60+$66+$72+$78+$84+$90+$96+$102+$108+$114+$120+$126+$132+$138+$144+$150+$156+$162+$168+$174+$180+$186;} {$193 = $7+$13+$19+$25+$31+$37+$43+$49+$55+$61+$67+$73+$79+$85+$91+$97+$103+$109+$115+$121+$127+$133+$139+$145+$151+$157+$163+$169+$175+$181+$187;} {$194 = $8+$14+$20+$26+$32+$38+$44+$50+$56+$62+$68+$74+$80+$86+$92+$98+$104+$110+$116+$122+$128+$134+$140+$146+$152+$158+$164+$170+$176+$182+$188;} {$195 = $9+$15+$21+$27+$33+$39+$45+$51+$57+$63+$69+$75+$81+$87+$93+$99+$105+$111+$117+$123+$129+$135+$141+$147+$153+$159+$165+$171+$177+$183+$189;}{print $0}' practice2_manycols.sync > practice2_manycols_sums.sync
```

We then want to see which rows have more then one allele represented among the populations. Ian and I decided that the cut off should be a count of 10 for across the population to be included. We will only be looking at the last 6 columns since those have our sums. 

So I ended up cutting out extra columns just to simplify the process and I also combined the chromosome and position information so that the position info wouldn't be used as an integer in the max per row (although I think you can actually just start the max count at the first column you want to consider, thus skipping over the position column, but I figured I'd simplify the process for myself anyways). I then took the max value of the row and put in the last column. Then, I did this mah equation to see if the max column minus all the other columns was less than the max minus 10 (we chose the value of 10 because we thought this was good representation across the lineages to be considered a real allele, however this isn't taking into account if we have a few alleles that occur but are not the same among the lineages at that position, i.e. 5As and 5Ts would meet the requirement of 10 other alleles but neither have good representation, but this site is probably still polymorphic).

```

awk -F "\t" '{ if($8+$8-$2-$3-$4-$5-$6-$7<=$8-10) { print } }' practice2_choosemax.sync > practice2_onlyimportantrows.sync
```

I want to put all the commands together and pipe them so it goes faster and doesn't create all these intermediate files.

The command below seems to work well as did the individual steps. In theory I would only have to change the input file and the output file name

```
awk 'gsub(/:/,"\t")' practice2.sync | awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} {$190 = $4+$10+$16+$22+$28+$34+$40+$46+$52+$58+$64+$70+$76+$82+$88+$94+$100+$106+$112+$118+$124+$130+$136+$142+$148+$154+$160+$166+$172+$178+$184;} {$191 = $5+$11+$17+$23+$29+$35+$41+$47+$53+$59+$65+$71+$77+$83+$89+$95+$101+$107+$113+$119+$125+$131+$137+$143+$149+$155+$161+$167+$173+$179+$185;} {$192 = $6+$12+$18+$24+$30+$36+$42+$48+$54+$60+$66+$72+$78+$84+$90+$96+$102+$108+$114+$120+$126+$132+$138+$144+$150+$156+$162+$168+$174+$180+$186;} {$193 = $7+$13+$19+$25+$31+$37+$43+$49+$55+$61+$67+$73+$79+$85+$91+$97+$103+$109+$115+$121+$127+$133+$139+$145+$151+$157+$163+$169+$175+$181+$187;} {$194 = $8+$14+$20+$26+$32+$38+$44+$50+$56+$62+$68+$74+$80+$86+$92+$98+$104+$110+$116+$122+$128+$134+$140+$146+$152+$158+$164+$170+$176+$182+$188;} {$195 = $9+$15+$21+$27+$33+$39+$45+$51+$57+$63+$69+$75+$81+$87+$93+$99+$105+$111+$117+$123+$129+$135+$141+$147+$153+$159+$165+$171+$177+$183+$189;}{print $1"_"$2,"\t",$190,"\t",$191,"\t",$192,"\t",$193,"\t",$194,"\t",$195}' | awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} {m=$2;for(i=1;i<=NF;i++)if($i>m)m=$i;$8 = m;print $0}' | awk -F "\t" '{ if($8+$8-$2-$3-$4-$5-$6-$7<=$8-10) { print } }' > practice2_onlyimportantrows_trial.sync
```

I am attempting to do this with the big sunc file now. I see that piping it is allowing all the awk to run at the same time which will hopefully speed up the process as it goes through a 62G file. 

So the other annoying thing I found out when I ran this is that it seems to be choosing charaters as a max value in a row as well. I did some testing. I tried to make the first column (with chromosome and position) a character by putting "chr" in front, but that made the max value for a row always be the "chr...". I think what is happening is that characters are the 'max' value. Like it organizes it alphabetically with numbers first and then number/character things after. So for some of the rows it was seeing that "2R_2378" was bigger than "22" because it would come after the "22" if those were listed alphabetically. I got around this issue by putiing a "0_" infront of the chromosome position column so now it reads "0_2R_2378". I'll split things later.
```

```
Okay, seems to be working!

Next thing is to separate the columns again and only print out a list that has the chromosome and position data so we know how to filter the other files.
```
awk 'gsub(/_/,"\t")' cvl_bwa_polymorphicSites.sync | awk '{print $2"_"$3}' > cvl_bwa_polymorphicSites_list.txt
```
Next, we'll filter the actual sync file based on this list we have

```
grep -w -F -f cvl_bwa_polymorphicSites_list.txt new_combinedcolumn.sync > cvl_bwa_polymorphicSites_subset.sync

# -w tells grep to match whole words only (i.e. so ABC123 won't also match ABC1234).
# -F search for fixed strings (plain text) rather than regular expressions
# -f cvl_bwa_polymorphicSites_list.txt read search patterns from this file (this is the list of positions with polumorphisms)
# new_combinedcolumn.sync is a the main chromosomes in a sync file with the chr and pos in a single column in the beginning. 
```
